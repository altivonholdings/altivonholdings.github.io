        <div class="blog-post-content">
          <p>The web platform evolves faster than ever. What was cutting‑edge five years ago is now standard. As we move through 2026, several trends are poised to reshape how we build and interact with websites. Here's what we're watching.</p>
          
          <h2>1. AI‑Powered Development</h2>
          <p>Tools like GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT aren't just novelties – they're becoming integral to developer workflows. From generating boilerplate code to debugging and even designing UI, AI assistants boost productivity and lower the barrier to entry. Expect deeper IDE integration and more specialised coding assistants.</p>
          
          <h2>2. WebAssembly (Wasm)</h2>
          <p>WebAssembly allows code written in C++, Rust, Go, and other languages to run in the browser at near‑native speed. This opens the door for complex applications like video editing, CAD, and games on the web. As Wasm gains garbage collection and threading support, it will increasingly compete with JavaScript.</p>
          
          <h2>3. Edge Computing and Jamstack</h2>
          <p>Static site generators (Next.js, Astro) and CDN‑based deployment (Vercel, Netlify) have shifted hosting from origin servers to the edge. Edge functions allow dynamic content generation close to users, reducing latency. This trend will continue, with more logic moving to the edge.</p>
          
          <blockquote>
            "The future of web development is faster, more interactive, and increasingly decentralised."
          </blockquote>
          
          <h2>4. Component‑First Frameworks</h2>
          <p>React, Vue, and Svelte have popularised component‑based architecture. The next wave is frameworks like Astro and Qwik, which ship zero JavaScript by default and progressively hydrate components only when needed. Performance and user experience are the main drivers.</p>
          
          <h2>5. Augmented Reality (AR) on the Web</h2>
          <p>WebXR brings virtual and augmented reality to browsers without native apps. Retail, real estate, and education are early adopters – imagine trying on clothes or previewing furniture in your living room through a browser.</p>
          
          <h2>6. Green Computing</h2>
          <p>Sustainability is becoming a priority. Optimised code, efficient hosting, and minimal data transfer reduce carbon footprints. Tools to measure and improve website energy efficiency will become mainstream.</p>
          
          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>The future is exciting, but the fundamentals remain: fast, accessible, and secure websites. At Altivon Holdings, we stay ahead of the curve so you don't have to. <a href="../contact.html">Let's build tomorrow's web, today.</a></p>
