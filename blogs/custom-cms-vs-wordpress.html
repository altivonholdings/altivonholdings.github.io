          <p>WordPress powers over 40% of the web. It's familiar, has thousands of plugins, and you can have a site running in hours. So why would any business choose a custom CMS? The answer lies in long‑term costs, security, and the need for unique functionality.</p>
          
          <h2>The Hidden Costs of WordPress</h2>
          <p>WordPress itself is free, but the ecosystem isn't. Premium themes and plugins add up. More importantly, maintaining a WordPress site requires constant updates, security monitoring, and often developer intervention when plugins conflict. A custom CMS can be tailored exactly to your needs, eliminating unused code and reducing attack surface.</p>
          
          <h2>1. Security</h2>
          <p>WordPress is the most targeted CMS because of its popularity. Vulnerabilities in plugins are common. A custom CMS built with a modern framework (Laravel, Django, Rails) can be hardened and doesn't have a public plugin directory for attackers to probe.</p>
          
          <h2>2. Performance</h2>
          <p>Out of the box, WordPress can be bloated. Even with optimisation plugins, you're loading code for features you may never use. A custom CMS includes only what you need, resulting in faster page loads and better Core Web Vitals – directly impacting SEO and user experience.</p>
          
          <h2>3. Scalability and Flexibility</h2>
          <p>WordPress can scale, but it requires significant expertise and infrastructure investment. Custom CMS architectures can be built headless, with decoupled frontends that serve content via APIs. This allows you to deliver content to mobile apps, smartwatches, and websites from a single backend – something traditional WordPress struggles with.</p>
          
          <blockquote>
            "A custom CMS is an investment in your digital future, not a race to the cheapest launch."
          </blockquote>
          
          <h2>4. User Experience for Editors</h2>
          <p>WordPress's admin panel is generic. A custom CMS can provide an intuitive, branded editing experience that matches your team's workflow. No more explaining what a "category" or "tag" means – you can label fields exactly as your editors understand them.</p>
          
          <h2>When WordPress Still Makes Sense</h2>
          <p>For simple blogs, brochure sites, or projects with very tight budgets, WordPress remains a valid choice. But if you anticipate growth, need unique functionality, or prioritise security and performance, a custom CMS is the smarter long‑term play.</p>
          
          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>At Altivon Holdings, we build custom CMS solutions tailored to your business logic. No bloat, no unnecessary plugins – just a system that works the way you do. <a href="../contact.html">Let's talk about your content strategy.</a></p>
